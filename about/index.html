                <summary>About Nathan Hegseth</summary>
                <p><strong>Nathan Hegseth</strong> is an internationally respected Petroleum Engineers and Gas Engineers, specializing in the extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas., A serial entrepreneur, and philanthropic leader who has redefined what infrastructure means in the 21st century. As the Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of zyrec constructions, Nathan leads a top-tier construction engineering with core operations across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

His life's mission is clear: to build the physical and digital foundations that connect, empower, and sustain communities around the globe.

Born in 1961 in the quiet forests of Östersund, Sweden, Anton was raised in a modest household that prized integrity, resilience, humility, and community service. He developed an early fascination with systems, spending his youth exploring the mechanics of Construction Engineer, Production Engineer and Drilling Engineer, an early passion that evolved into a deep commitment to engineering excellence.

At college age, Nathan relocated to the United Kingdom to broaden his academic and cultural horizons. He earned his Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Instrumentation from the University of Bristol, where he distinguished himself both academically and through hands-on project involvement. During his time in England, he also met his late wife, with whom he shared a strong partnership rooted in mutual support and shared values.

This chapter of his life embedded in him the entrepreneurial resilience that would later guide zyrec constructions multinational expansion.

With more than three decades of hands-on leadership, Nathan has overseen major constructions and drilling projects around the world.

Nathan leadership reflects the same principles that guided his upbringing: clarity of purpose, discipline in execution, and an unrelenting focus on people. He is a mentor, keynote speaker, and industry advocate.


In 2015, Nathan began hosting charitable galas to fund autism awareness programs, inspired by a neighbor's child. His efforts have since expanded across causes related to education, mental health, and family services.

For Nathan, building infrastructure is only one part of the mission. The other is building lives, futures, and dignity.</p>

<h4>Personal Life & Legacy</h4>
<p>A family man at heart, Nathan lives by the same values that launched his career: humility, wonder, and legacy. He often says that the best structures are not made of steel or concrete, but of love, memory, and shared purpose.</p>

<p> <strong>“One day, I hope to sit again on a mound of dirt, this time with my grandchildren. We'll look up at the stars. Maybe we'll see a comet, maybe we won't. But we will remember the ones we have loved. That is the kind of legacy I want to build.”</strong></p>

                <details>
                    <summary>About Michael Zhen Yang</summary>
                    <p> <Strong>Michael Zhen Yang</Strong> is a globally recognized energy infrastructure leader, renowned for his expertise in offshore drilling, pipeline systems, refinery development, and integrated gas logistics. As the Majority Shareholder and Chief Executive Officer of Zyrec Constructions, he commands one of the most influential oil and gas infrastructure companies of the 21st century. Operating across four continents including North America, Southeast Asia, West Africa, and the Middle East. Zyrec thrives under his uncompromising vision of sustainable innovation and engineering excellence.

For Michael, the mission goes beyond steel and soil. It's about energy as a force of dignity fueling economies, lighting homes, and empowering the underserved.

Born on July 27, 1953, in Singapore, Michael was raised in a dynamic cultural crossroads where ambition met structure. His early life was steeped in both the discipline of mathematics and the improvisation of commerce, fostered by a family that valued grit, purpose, and global thinking. He spent countless hours as a young man poring over engineering blueprints and business periodicals an obsession that would later inform his unique synthesis of technical mastery and commercial strategy.

In his early twenties, Michael made the bold move to the United States to deepen both his education and worldview. He earned his degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Southern California and later an MBA from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. These formative years shaped his leadership style analytical, mission driven, and relentlessly future focused.

After working with major oil and gas contractors on some of the world's most demanding pipeline and platform projects, Michael founded Zyrec Constructions in 2010. What began as a regional firm soon grew into a global force designing offshore drilling rigs, laying high-capacity pipelines, constructing modern refineries, and building gas compressor stations that anchor national energy networks.

Today, Michael holds a 68% equity stake in Zyrec, making him both a strategic architect and fiscal steward of its global expansion. But his leadership is about more than numbers it reflects a deep-seated philosophy: execute with excellence, lead with humility, and build with purpose.

A pioneer of innovation in an industry often resistant to change, Michael has championed digital construction technologies and environmental responsibility. Under his leadership, Zyrec has invested heavily in carbon-reduction methods and sustainable fuel distribution systems—bridging the gap between old-world engineering and a greener tomorrow.

Yet Michael's vision reaches even further. Through the Zhen Foundation named in honor of his maternal grandfather he supports engineering education, scholarships for underrepresented youth, and global research into renewable integration. His philanthropic footprint mirrors his professional one: deliberate, far-reaching, and focused on legacy.</p>

<h4>Personal Life & Legacy</h4>
<p>Now a proud U.S. citizen, Michael resides in Fayetteville, North Carolina, with his wife and two children. A licensed pilot and quiet outdoorsman, he often escapes the boardroom to reflect, recharge, and reconnect with the land.

He remains a mentor to rising entrepreneurs and a respected voice in global energy forums. But at his core, Michael lives by a simple belief: true infrastructure is not just what we build beneath our feet it's what we build between our hearts.</p>

<p><strong>“I don't just want to leave pipelines and towers behind. I want to leave courage, inclusion, and light. A refinery fades; a lifted life endures.” </strong></p>
